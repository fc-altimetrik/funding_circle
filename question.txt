Loan allocation coding challenge
One of the requirements of the Funding Circle marketplace is that it fairly allocates loans to investors, within the constraints of certain investor specified criteria.

In this coding challenge you are required to write some code that takes as input a set of loans and a set of investors, and returns as output a structure indicating which loans have been allocated to each investor. Each loan can only be allocated to a single investor, and investors will only fund loans that meet their specified criteria.

Loans
Loans are modelled such that they have the following attributes:

id - The unique ID of the loan
category - The category of the loan (Property, Retail, Medical)
risk_band - The risk band associated with the loan (A+, A, B, C, D, E)
amount - The amount of the loan in Â£
So an example loan would look something like:

{
  "id": 1234567,
  "category": "property",
  "risk_band": "A",
  "amount": 1000
}
Investors
As mentioned above, your code should fairly allocate loans according to certain investor specified criteria. Investors should also not be able to fund more loans than they have money to invest.

Plan your system to meet the requirements of the first three investors, Bob, Susan, and George. Once you are able to reach a working solution for Part I, think about how to extend your system to cover Helen and Jamie's use cases.

Part I

Bob - only wants to invest in property loans.
Susan - will invest in either property or retail loans.
George - only wants to invest in "A" grade loans.
Part II

Helen - wants to invest in a maximum of 40% property loans.
Jamie - wants to invest only in high grade (>= B) property loans.
Notes
All state should be handled in memory
